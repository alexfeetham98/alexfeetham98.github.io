									<h1>Super Trash Heroes 2022</h1>
									<p>Super Trash Heroes is a side scrolling multiplayer beat-em up inspired by games like streets of rage series and double dragon series.
										Itâ€™s a serious game with an eco-friendly message that takes players across the world to have them deal with issues like pollution, overproduction of food, recycling and more.</p>

								<p>STH was originally created by PlayWest as part of the Global Game Jam in 2015 and was shelved shortly thereafter.
									As a part of the Commercial Games Studio module, my team and I chose to revive the project and take it from its early alpha stages and bring it through to gold.</p>
								<p>The game can be played solo or with up to 4 player local co-op.
									Gameplay consists of players progressing through the levels and beating up bad guys, while completing level specific objectives. Players have limited health and lives per level and in the event of all player losing all lives the level is started from the beginning.
									Each level is finished off with a boss event such as a classic boss fight against a strong enemy, a race, or a gauntlet.</p>
								<p>The game is relatively short, with a full playthrough taking 15-45 minutes depending on the skill level of players and their familiarity with the game, with an emphasis on short and sweet playthrough with a lot of variety rather than extended playthrough and mechanics overstaying their welcome.
									STH was targeted at children as an educational game as it can help them to understand the different environmental issues we face as a society these days.</p>
